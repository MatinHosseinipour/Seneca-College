Firstly, the important thing i have learnt in these two milestones was, although the clear keyboard function is very useful 
but i do not have to put it everywhere tho. first, i have added it everywhere, and i could not get the write output while
my code was right. it was really confusing to get the idea that the enters i add everyline while the program is not working at all 
is because of this little function

secondly, i have believed in functions and classed morethan before, by writing one function yes() and using it everywhere else that
we have included the appropriate header. which really makes us to write an optimized program

thirdly, after debugging the program, i have realized how easy it was by going to each function to fixing some problem there. in other
word writing an organized and neat program helps us to find and fix the bugs way easier. at least we do not have to spend much time
on finding that part of the program.
