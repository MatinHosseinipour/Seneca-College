by doing two last milestones of this project, my whole opinion regarding programming has changed. during the process, i have got some
errors that when i was searching for them, realized wooh someone else had this error too, lets see what is the response from microsoft
and the response was not nothing but "we have send your problem to our engineers department, but due to lacking informations they are
not able to solve your problem". At that moment i felt like i was burning and freezing at the same time, i also was cold sweeting. after 
contacting friends and asking about their opinion could not fix anything unless some miracle happened and a friend said forget about the 
visual studio try to run it on matrix, at hopefully i got one less problem that moment xD. although it took more time, that i had to upload
check edit and reupload the whole project everytime, but it worthed it.

for the benefits of find index and get ten digit functions i can write an essay to be honest. Because they have been used nearly in every
function through the process. instead of writing a same code everywhere, we simply wrote a function and used that everywhere which
optimized the project and avoids dirty coding.

as i said before it would be much better if we use something like a text file as a data base. because everytime our client opens the app
it will make Contacts with same old information, and while our client enters different information by closing the app, the whole thing 
will be deleted and we are at the first point again. so by using a text file as a data base we will avoid these situations from happening.
not only that, but also we will be able to make unlimited slots for saving contacts base on the storage.
