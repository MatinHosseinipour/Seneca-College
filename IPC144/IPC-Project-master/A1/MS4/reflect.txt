First bug is regarding the middle initials, it also includes the last name which is not about cleaning the buffer,
indeed is about not getting the right input based on our variable. the scanf code is seeking for an input with 6 
characters length, while our variable has been set to 5 characters length so im gonna change that to 7 (one more than
our need) and will try debugging it. and yup, this was the problem and is solved now

the second bug is that while we get done with getting the name information and trying to move out of the getName function
we get an error saying yesNo variable is corrupted. by checking the codes related to this variable, we will understand that
the problem is that we are using %s while we try to scan a character to save into our variable which is completely wrong
because it is for strings not characters, by changing it to %c our problem is solved

the thirs bug is than when i enter yes to add my apartment number it skippes that part. it flawlessly gets the input from
the user for example 'y' and stores it into the variable yesNo, but surprisingly it does not enter the if condition. and finnaly 
found that the problem is that in our if condition we are using double quotation "" for our condition while checking the character
which is wrong and has to be single quotation ''

the fourth problem is that, while we are saying yes we want to add home cellphone number it skippes that part too. by taking a
look at our code line 85 we will recognize that the problem is our if condition, while checking the input character we are checking
if the input character is y and Y at the same time which does not make sense in the real world either. the condition has to be changed
from && to ||

-----------------------------------------------------------------

our contact struct is based on three different structs. at first it may look like an over-coding, but it really helps us to organize 
our code, by differentiating between the name information, address and numbers. in other hand, we are avoiding dirty coding by
writing all of the in an organized way. basically when we make a contact struct, it automatically creates three different structs
with different variables and inputs and stores all their addresses into itself.


-------------------


the repetition part of the contacts.c is regarding to the situations we are asking the user if he wants to add some extra information
or not. in other words, every time we are asking the user to enter y or n we are repeating a same pattern and we can write that in a 
seperate function which only return 0 or 1, which represents true or false;

this can be our function

int getYesNo() {
    char yesNo;
    scanf("%c%*c", &yesNo);
    if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y') {
        return 1;
    }
    else {
        return 0;
    }
}

and for example if i try to merge it in our first part which is asking about initials it would be like this

printf("Do you want to enter a middle initial(s)? (y or n): ");
    if (getYesNo()) {
        printf("Please enter the contact's middle initial(s): ");
        scanf("%6[^\n]%*c", name->middleInitial);
    }

---------------------------

it basically means to ignore the next character such as space, slash, dash and etc.
we need it here because we mostly have spaces in our inputs and we ought to ignore them in order 
to store the write input in our variables

-------------------------

we mostly used %[^\n] instead of %s and that is because %[^\n] means read all the input in the buffer
until \n occurs, which %s is not working like this and may cause corruption in getting our inputs correctly
