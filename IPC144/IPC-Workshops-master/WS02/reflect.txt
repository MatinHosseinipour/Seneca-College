	If I say week 02 assignment was a little challanging, I did not exaggerate. Especially when we are working 
with a various of formulas, you know by making even a small mistake the whole program will go wrong. In Addition, "scanf" 
was a new command that i have learnt in C language, it is one of the important commands in C which comes with different 
input types (e.g. %d,%f,%1f). There may not be any differnce between some of the input types at the first look, but in action 
there actually is a huge gap between them. For instance, %f and %1f may look same and even if you use them instead of eachother 
you will not get any error but truth is one of them is for float and the other is for double and by entering different numbers 
you will have a problem there. Moreover, I have learnt that we as a programmer can limit the user in different situations. 
Like when we are asking the user to enter a number as the amount to be paid, we can limit the length of the amount (decimals 
in this case) by adding 0.2 or.2 in between defining the input type (%0.2f or %.2f).
	Although, I have learnt that in C language, the computer never does round the numbers. It always truncates the 
numbers. Though, the solution of this problem is you always add 5 to the last digit of our numbers and then when computer 
truncates, it technically rounds the number.

	P.S. I had to use float and %f for my assignments, because otherwise I would always get and error in matrix.
