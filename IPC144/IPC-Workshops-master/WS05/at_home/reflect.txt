//==============================================



	To be honest, this workshop was a little challenging for me. the new code that i have learnt in this week was the struct.
First, i was thinking like it is an useless command while we have array. But after using it for work i realized that it could be much
better than arrays. Because in arrays we have to use numbers for declaring rows and columns while here for each row and column we
are able to set names, which really makes it easier for us to find and use the varialbes stored in them.

	Two challenging parts that i have had in at home part was about part 1 ,3 and 4. for part 1 i realized if i still use the variable
'i' in parts 3 and 4, i would have problem for printing my struct and it would not print anything at all. And for the parts 3 and 4, the
stupidest thing that i did was that when i was searching for the ID and checking if it is available i forgot to put two '=' in my condition
tho it was changing all my structs to that wrong input instead of checking them.

	There were also something wrong with the part 2 that we can call it a bug. Which was that everytime we were going to part
2 we were increasing 'count' by 1. And then we would check if we could add anymore employees. Tho if the user would try to add employee
7 times, 'count' would be 6 and even if we would delete an employee data, we still would not be able to add any employee because (count > SIZE).
The solution i used to fix this bug was to add a line 'count--' after the error saying we do not have enough space for adding.

	And for the last question, if i am right, if we would declare the employee struct in a seperate database file, it would be 
much better and more convinient for users and also the programmers. Because we could save the variables and use them the next time
we were using the program.
