First of Accept my apologize for being late this much! after passing the deadline i thought im not able to submit anymore and didnt
try until doing in lab workshop 4 which was written late submissions will get penalty, usually students should not get proud of getting
late marks but for me getting late marks for now is better than getting nothing :D thanks professor for giving me your valuabe time.


	By upgrading the in lab part to the instructions given for at home part, i realized that i have to say good bye to easy
programming because here i had to save and store the values. So first i was thinking of i may have to make 8 different values for 4
days and each high and low, but it was the stupidest way ever. Though i chose to write it with arrays, even it was much easier at every
angle. because i could use that array for determining nearly everything. So I also changed the way i used to determine the total mean
and used 'for' this time to get total and finding the mean.
	Not to mention, after finishing the whole program, the idea of using functions just popped in my mind, and i was like, "Wow,
it could have been even easier than this". If i would write a function for calculating the average, i could use that three times, instead
of rewriting the same computation three times only with different names and variables. But no one would understand which way is better
unless they try, right? now atleast i have the experience and next time i will first check if i can do that with functions.
