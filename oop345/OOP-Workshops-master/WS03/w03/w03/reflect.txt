first of we do not make cpp files and we code in the header files because when we use templates we should write the code
within our header file we cannot code for the templates typename in the cpp
secondly we used initial in our constructor just in case if the input was missing we have a default value for our variable type 
V
thirdly, we had to specialize the the operator because we wanna do something different with the string rather than other
types.
we dont need to specialiaze initial variable because the null is basically the same for all the variables so we dont really need
to specialize that while we can use {}
forth, because we made them static we had to define them outside the class as well to let the compiler know that these statics
belong to those classes
not to mention that i had to specialize the class for int string while it was not mentioned because i was getting an error saying
the class would not work for the input int string
