The purpose of this workshop was to work and pointers to understand their concept deeply
Here i have used delete operator in order to use raw pointers.
"
    Product *temp = new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price);
	temp->validate();
    priceList += temp;
    delete temp;
"
in the example as it is obvious i have deleted the pointer right away to avoid memory leak in order to obtimize the program
To mention a difference between raw and smart pointers we can say sometimes that we might forget to deallocate we will use
smart pointers to make sure they will be deallocated automatically.

on some other part of the code i also used the smart pointer as i mentioned bellow
"
    std::shared_ptr<Product> temp(new Product(desc[i].desc, price[j].price));
    temp->validate();
    priceList += temp;
"
as it is obvious there was no need of deallocation since we would not have any memory leak.
