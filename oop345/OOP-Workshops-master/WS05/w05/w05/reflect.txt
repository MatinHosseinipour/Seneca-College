the new stuff that i was working with in this workshop was the try catch, the lambda expression and the observer
although observer was pretty easy it was pretty interesting as well to watch how it does the job.
the use of functor and lambda are kinda. functor edits the input while lambda uses the some inputs to change the other inputs
i guess when we want may change some of the parameters we should use the functor and when we are sure we want some of them constant
we better use lambda
client giving a wrong file name in my opinion is better to be catched by the exceptions to let the client know what is wrong
i would prefer having the exception but i would let the client to enter the file name one more time just in case if he did a typo he can fix that
like what we did for the spellchecking i would make a module to load the data fix the spaces and trim it, then i would send them to their constructor
and they just have to set the data.
the default constructor is indeed necessary, because we didnt pass the data directly doesnt mean data doesnt go there indirectly, which it does
basically their constructors would be overloaded and our data will go where it has to
