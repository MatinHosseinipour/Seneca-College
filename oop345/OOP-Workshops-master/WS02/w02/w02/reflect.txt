well been a long time and we fixed the problem together. i didnt have to make the struct static since it is default static and it was the debugging error
that did not allow me to submit on time. and i believe the purpose of the workshop was to work with the <chrono> (timing) in programming in order to 
compare different methods to be able and write the most sufficient code
but thanks to you for the extension
