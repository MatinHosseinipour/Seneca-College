in both restaurant and confirmationsender modules, the reservation is being created deleted or modified since it has been
managing the object we are using composition in this workshop. since the only independent module is the reservation module
therefore we do not have any associations. it can be like the person and name example on the site, name is independent but
person was working based on name and its own variables[age] here, both restaurant and confirmation sender have their own
variables but their protagonist is the reservation module.
