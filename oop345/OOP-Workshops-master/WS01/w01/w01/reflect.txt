workshop 1

im really happy that we started the course with this workshop
it kinda included the parts from the previous course which made it to be a good warm up
the difference between internal and external is that in interval you cannot use the
interval on the other classes but when when you make it external like the g_sysclock
which we have used it on other classes like our main.
when you make it static it does not remove and create the variable everytime we use it
everytime. for example the counter variable that by making it static we avoided reseting 
the value.
for the class event i had to make the char variable dynamic in order to avoid the maximum
length and save some storage.
