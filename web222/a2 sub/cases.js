/*******************************************************************************
 * Problem 0: learn how to work with the cases data.
 *
 * Welcome to Assignment 2! In this assignment, you're going to be practicing
 * different ways of working with JavaScript Objects, both built-in Objects
 * like Array and String, and also working with custom Objects you create.
 *
 * Before you dive into all the problems below, let's spend a minute helping you
 * learn how to work with the sample user data included in this assignment.
 *
 * We've included two extra files in this assignment, `toronto-covid-cases-full.json`
 * and `toronto-covid-cases-partial.json`.
 *
 * These are JSON files, which is a text format for representing Objects (NOTE:
 * we'll talk more about JSON in later weeks, and you can read more about it at
 * https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON).
 *
 * You can think of JSON files like mini databases for loading Object data into
 * a program. We'll use it in this assignment to load a list of COVID-19 case
 * data for the City of Toronto.
 *
 * The City of Toronto publishes this data every week at the following URL:
 *
 * https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/
 *
 * You can download the data in a number of formats:
 *
 * - JSON: https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/e5bf35bc-e681-43da-b2ce-0242d00922ad?format=json
 * - CSV: https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/e5bf35bc-e681-43da-b2ce-0242d00922ad?format=csv
 * - XML: https://ckan0.cf.opendata.inter.prod-toronto.ca/download_resource/e5bf35bc-e681-43da-b2ce-0242d00922ad?format=xml
 *
 * This COVID-19 Case data is an Array where each item in the Array is a custom
 * Case Object. The Array is really [case1, case2, case3, ...], and each Case
 * Object has the following structure:
 *
 *  {
 *      "Age Group": "40 to 49 Years",
 *      "Neighbourhood Name": "Annex",
 *      "Outcome": "RESOLVED",
 *      "Client Gender": "FEMALE",
 *      "Classification": "CONFIRMED",
 *      "FSA": "M5R",
 *      "Currently Hospitalized": "No",
 *      "Episode Date": "2020-09-12",
 *      "Assigned_ID": 17712,
 *      "Outbreak Associated": "Sporadic",
 *      "Ever Intubated": "No",
 *      "Reported Date": "2020-09-16",
 *      "Currently in ICU": "No",
 *      "Source of Infection": "Healthcare",
 *      "_id": 161028,
 *      "Ever in ICU": "No",
 *      "Ever Hospitalized": "No",
 *      "Currently Intubated": "No"
 *  }
 *
 * We've provided two versions of this file, because the amount of data is so large.
 * The file `toronto-covid-cases-full.json` contains 17,872 Case Objects and is
 * 10M in size! This file is a complete history of COVID-19 Case data in Toronto,
 * but is so large that your computer might have trouble processing it.
 *
 * If you want to use a smaller sample data set, we also include the file
 * `toronto-covid-cases-partial.json`, which contains 500 case Objects, and is
 * easier/faster to process.
 *
 * The unit tests in the problem test files will use the smaller file,
 * `toronto-covid-cases-partial.json`. However, your code in `analysis.js`
 * will use the complete `toronto-covid-cases-full.json` file.

 *
 * To get you started, write a function that gets the first element in the
 * cases Array, and returns only the _id String for this case.
 *
 * You can try running this test using the following command:
 *
 * npm test problem-00

 * See if you can get this test to pass by fixing the bug in the code below.

 * String:
 *
 * the case's Neighbourhood Name, a space, a '(', the Outcome, and a ')':

/*******************************************************************************
 * Problem 05: getCasesByNeighbourhood()
 *
 * Write function to get the case Object(s) for a given Neighbourhood Name.
 * Your function can be used in two ways.
 *
 * First, it can be used to do an exact match against the Neighbourhood Name
 * property, matching the whole name and its case:
 *
 * getCasesByNeighbourhood(cases, 'Niagara') should return an Array of case
 * Objects, where all cases have 'Niagara' for their Neighbourhood Name. If there
 * are no Objects that use this Neighbourhood Name, the returned Array should be
 * empty.  For example, getCasesByNeighbourhood(cases, 'unknown') would return
 * the empty Array [].  NOTE: with an exact match, 'Niagara' and 'niagara' are
 * not the same.
 *
 * The second way to use your function is to do a fuzzy match.  A fuzzy match
 * is a match where the given search string appears anywhere in the target, and
 * the match works regardless of case. For example, the string 'gar' would match
 * 'Niagara', since 'Niagara' contains 'gar', and 'Niagara' would also be a fuzzy
 * match with 'nia', even though the case is wrong.
 *
 * getCasesByNeighbourhood(cases, 'gar', true) should return an Array of case
 * Objects, where all the cases have a Neighbourhood Name that includes the
 * substring 'gar'.  NOTE the third argument `true` here, which indicates that
 * a fuzzy match is to be performed.
 *
 * One more issue to consider: not all Neighbourhood Names have been set in the
 * data, some are `null`.  Make sure you ignore these.
