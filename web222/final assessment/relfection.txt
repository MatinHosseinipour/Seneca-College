so about the forms. i used to think that we need js to work with them. i was really shocked that i realized
for sending the data we dont need to code any js at all , that action tag i mean. form tag is a world itself
a lot of features input types pattern name everything. it is nearly flawless. you receive whatever you want
with forms without any concern. for validation ofcourse i did not know about patterns and i used a method
for onclick and was checking the users input with regex in js but after i went to do for the contact page
i searched a little more and realized the thing i did with js i can easily do it with pattern attribute and its
regex as well. again after that i realized im such an idiot because when you set the input type to email
it does everything it self and i dont have to do anything. :|
by finishing coding i loaded the page and tried some garbage values in the inputs and that was the way i found
the bugs in my patterns or anything. and it was easy to fix because when you enter garbage value for tel
and it submits that you definitely know the problem is the pattern of tel input.
my advice is that they should learn everything about forms before doing anything. because when you know
the ways of doing stuff you would not do what i did at first and do not have to bother yourself coding extra.
searching is the key. some valid websites like w3schools and stackoverflow are really neccessary because
you will see when others had to do the same what problems they had and how they have fixed them.

i have uploaded the theme on one of my own sites.
