its been told that the purpose of this workshop was to keep practising on some of the old lectures like
inheriting classes, base member functions and more importantly overloading functions
overall i think it was a complete wrap up on the lectures we had lately about classes
and im guessing like were going on a new stage from now. overall it was all the same, working
and doing the stuff we did before, which was actually really helpfull. me myself had some tiny mistakes
and doing these one more time will definitely help me to keep in mind not making them again. last but not least
i guess i should be ready for the upcoming stage.
