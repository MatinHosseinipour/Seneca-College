the DIY was pretty much like the lab part but easier, in other word doing the lab was the actual coding part, DIY was a little editing.
before i forgot i have to confess that i was acting dumb because i guess i did not pay enough attention on your lectures that i didnt know
we have lab at all, even though i have been looking for the instructions for the workshop for almost two days :/ no one could understand
im really looking for the instruction an i cant just scroll down the git hub page to see what is there. although i know youve written that
if we miss even one part you are going to give 0 mark for it, i thought it might be better to submit than not submitting at all.
for the program as i said it was pretty much like the lab part, it had some identical part which i just coppied from the lab codes like the open,
close, load, flush..., yes and some other functions that i couldnt use the exact same code so i just had to edit them to do the process i want, for 
instance hasGenre function could be changed and be used as a search function in DIY. also it was easier than the lab because we were looking 
for less fields in the file! 
last but not least, i have used some confusing short names that i hope it would be alright.
