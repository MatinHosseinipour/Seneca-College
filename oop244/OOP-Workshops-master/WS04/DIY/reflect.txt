In this workshop focus pretty much was on constructors and destructors. we were pushed to use default
and modified constructors with different inputs rather than normal functions in order to optimize the project
and understand the ease of using them. like using destructor as an dealocator in order to code less than before.
we also implemented the use of reference 'this' for the function read to go even further. this workshop was 
an easy one, which mainly is because constructors and destructors are made to make it easy for us.
