its been told that the purpose of this workshop was to keep practising on some of the old lectures like
constructors, dynamic memories nad overloading functions and more importantly overloading iostreams
which i had problems working with them. but overall i think it was a complete wrap up on all the lectures
we had so far and im guessing like were going on a new stage from now. overall it was all the same, working
and doing the stuff we did before, which was actually really helpfull. me myself had some tiny mistakes
and doing these one more time will definitely help me to keep in mind not making them again. last but not least
i guess i should be ready for the upcoming stage.
