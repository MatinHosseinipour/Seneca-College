This workshop was pretty easy considering the last one.The purpose of the workshop was to get used to overloadings,
refrences and dynamic memories allovation. We had plenty of overload functions which was a good exercise in order 
to learn them. The lab part was harder than the diy, because basically only the subject had changed and all I had to
do was to update the codes to change them from a basic school exam markings to bank account balances.
one of the major problems i had was it diy which made me spend two hours on it. i first tried to code with
class instead of struct because you said from now on we have to go by class but when i was reading datas,
i would display bunch of nonesence numbers instead of the actual data, spending hours of debugging and
changing everything, i changed that class to struct to go line by line by my lab part and at the end i thought
it may help if i change "%d," with "%d%c*" and surprisingly problem solved but i did not have enough time to 
change back the struct to class because it needed a lot of work for public functions in order to setting data
into private parameters.
