This workshop was a little unexpected. because we were used to have some pre-made modules and we only had
to finish editing them. but in this one we had to write them from the scratch and that was unexpected, because
i never paid enough attention to those ifndef comments before and i didnt know about that untill i had to write
them by myself earlier this week.
overall this workshop was good for me, however giving styles to the texts, is not easy as it looks like, because 
even a single dash can result in "NOT CORRECT OUTPUT". But in order to avoid them we tried to organize
and split every task like using two functions in order to print header and footer of our result and printing the
actual data in one other function , which helped alot, because if we had any problem we only had to fix one time.
at the end, it was a pretty good time to use constructors and destructors but i did not use them because i did not
have much time and didnt want to risk something new and losing time on searching on google and fixing bugs so.
