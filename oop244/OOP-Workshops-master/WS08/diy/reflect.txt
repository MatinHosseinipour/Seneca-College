its been told that the purpose of this workshop was to keep practising on inheriting classes. so basically
i was ready to work with the classes, but again like previous workshops, it was a mix of old lectures. and
by doing all these workshops so far, happily i dont make mistakes anymore. nothing else comes to my mind
to be honest to write here. basically it was same as the old workshops and ive said mostly everything. so i 
guess i better save some for next workshop as well :D.
