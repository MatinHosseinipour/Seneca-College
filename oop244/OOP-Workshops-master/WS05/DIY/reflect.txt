this one was pretty easy to be honest. ofcourse the purpose of this workshop was to get used to operators
and it had some tiny details like if we wanted to overload the actual += operator we have to do that outside
of our class (i guess i did not pay enough attention in the class, because i had to look at all the sources and
the lecture again to see what am i doing wrong lol) lab was half way done so dont need any explanation. for
the diy part i tried as much as possible to optimize my program by putting every repeating part into one
function like setGPA and setGrade. in diy i chose a different way to check the validity of the array by
using bool d_valid; tho everytime we were setting new grade i had to call the set gpa and grade again 
and set the validity again. not going to lie i wanted to set those steps into one setMark function but i just
thought it would be really foolish if i do that so i just went this way. and yeah thats it my reflection on this
workshop.
