lets start with a missunderstanding that i had on this workshop. its been said that using collection template
write a function so i thought the prototype should be the collection, and after some time thinking about
how is it possible for a collection function to return either true or false, i finnaly decided to change it 
to a bool function LOL. alright the purpose of this short workshop was to work with templates, which is 
really usefull, like you gave us an example of adding two variables together, we can avoid writing many
simillar functions by substituting the template with identifiers (double,int or whatever). this one was pretty
easy and to be honest really short that made me thinking something really difficult should be coming for the
workshop 10 and i should be ready for it. last but not least, thank you for giving such easy and short workshops
:D
