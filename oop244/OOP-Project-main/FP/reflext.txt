Hello professor, first of i have to confess that i need not expect the final exam at all. i was thinking like
it would be our final exam lol. ok i have to confess something else too. i have completely forgot about the fact
that we had menu module at first milestone, and i thought it is some kind of a challange that we have to figure
that out how to structure the menu module, so forgive me if that is different than what we had to do. as you
broke it into steps the project became like a piece of cake. couldnt be easier than this. although at some points
i wanted to throw my laptop out of the window, it wasnt about the project, that was because it works with "naft"
and im tired of it lol. thank you so much for giving us your time through the semester and taught us c++ language
its been a really fun and easy journey with you and i owe it to a such professor like you.
overall im happy that i took this course with you, you were always available for help as ive seen you helping
other classmates and been teaching so well on online sessions and also i thank you for caring about students who
might fell asleep at the session (talking about myself :D forgive me if i slept sometimes tbh 8 in the morning is hard xD)
the only thing that i did not like about the course was the quizes as you can my grades not good either or ive
missed some of them. for such a course (programming course) workshops should be our measurements not quizes
because some people especially me may not pay attention to the details but be good at coding. for example 
i would never say i need a binary something somewhere, i would say i need for example integer overthere.

thank you so much again for everything that was all
sincerely,
Matin
